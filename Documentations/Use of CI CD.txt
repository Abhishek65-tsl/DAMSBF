Issues with Direct PRs Without CI/CD
Bypassing CI/CD pipelines when moving code from development to QA to production would introduce 
several significant risks and issues:

Technical Issues

1. Undetected Bugs and Regressions
Build failures would not be caught until manual testing
Syntax errors could make it to production
Regression bugs might slip through without automated tests
Integration issues between components would remain hidden

2. Inconsistent Environments
"Works on my machine" syndrome - code that works in development might fail in production due to 
environment differences
Dependency conflicts would only be discovered during manual testing or worse, in production
Configuration discrepancies between environments would cause unpredictable behavior


3. Deployment Problems
Manual deployment steps could be forgotten or performed incorrectly
Incomplete deployments where some files are missed
Downtime during deployment would be longer without automated processes
No automated rollback capability if issues are discovered


Process Issues
1. Quality Control Gaps
No enforced code quality standards (linting, formatting)
No automated test execution to verify functionality
Security vulnerabilities might not be detected without security scanning
Performance issues would only be discovered in production

2. Workflow Inefficiencies
Manual verification required at each stage
Slower feedback loops for developers
Increased coordination overhead between team members
Inconsistent release processes depending on who performs them

3. Documentation and Traceability
No automated build artifacts with versioning
Reduced traceability of what code is deployed where
Harder to pinpoint which changes caused issues
No deployment history automatically recorded


Specific to Your React Project

1. Frontend-Specific Issues
Browser compatibility issues not caught by automated tests
Broken UI components that automated visual testing would catch
Bundle size increases not flagged automatically
JavaScript errors that could crash the application

2. Python AI Model Integration Challenges
Integration failures between React frontend and Python backend
Dependency conflicts between different language ecosystems
API contract violations not caught automatically
Performance bottlenecks in the AI model affecting the frontend


Real-World Impact

Reduced team velocity due to manual work and bug fixing
Lower product quality and user satisfaction
Increased stress during releases
Higher risk of critical production issues
Difficulty onboarding new interns without a standardized process
