Here's a breakdown of what you need to do:

1. Local Setup (One-Time Configuration):

Install gh-pages: Open your terminal, go to your project's folder, and run:
shell

npm install gh-pages --save-dev
Tell React where your website will live: Edit your package.json file. Add a line like this, 
replacing the parts in <> with your info:
json

{
      "homepage": "https://<your-github-username>.github.io/<your-repository-name>"
    }
If you are deploying to a custom domain, set the `homepage` to your domain.
Add deployment commands: Still in package.json, find the "scripts": section and add these lines:
json

"scripts": {
      "predeploy": "npm run build",
      "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"
    }
*Note:* Vite typically uses `dist` as the output directory. 
If your configuration is different, adjust the `-d` flag accordingly.

2. Deployment (Each Time You Update Your Site):

Build your project: In your terminal, run:
shell

npm run build
This creates a folder (usually called `dist`) with the files that make up your website.
Deploy to GitHub Pages: Run this command:
shell

npm run deploy
This command takes the files from the `dist` folder and puts them on a special branch called `gh-pages` 
in your GitHub repository.


3. GitHub Configuration (One-Time):

Go to your GitHub repository's settings.
Find the "Pages" section (usually on the left).
Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch".
Choose the gh-pages branch and the / (root) directory.
Save.



In Simple Terms:

You prepare your project for deployment by installing a tool (gh-pages) and 
telling React where it will be hosted.
You build your project to create the website files.
You run the deploy command, which puts those files on the gh-pages branch.
You tell GitHub to serve your website from that gh-pages branch.
What to do now:





When you run npm run deploy locally, the gh-pages package does the following:

Builds your project: It executes the predeploy script, which in your case runs npm run build. 
This creates the production-ready files for your website in the dist directory.

Creates or updates the gh-pages branch: It creates a new branch named gh-pages in your local Git repository 
(if it doesn't already exist) or updates it if it does. This branch contains only the files from your dist 
directory.

Commits the files to the gh-pages branch: It commits all the files in the dist directory to the 
gh-pages branch.

Pushes the gh-pages branch to your GitHub repository: This is the crucial step. The gh-pages package 
automatically pushes the gh-pages branch to your remote GitHub repository.

Because gh-pages handles the push to the remote repository, you don't need to manually run git push 
origin gh-pages. The npm run deploy command does it for you.
